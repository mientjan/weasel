# weasel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mientjan/weasel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mientjan/weasel)
Weasel library provides a full, hierarchical display list, a core interaction model, and helper classes to make working with the HTML5 Canvas element much easier. This started as fork of CreateJS/EaselJS and all credit should go to that library.
